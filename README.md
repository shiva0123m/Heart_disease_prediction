Project Description
In this project, we have developed a predictive model for heart disease using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of various attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and more. It aims to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on these parameters.
Dataset
We used the following dataset for this project:
